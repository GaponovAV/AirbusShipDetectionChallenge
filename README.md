# AirbusShipDetectionChallenge

I ran my code in a file on Kaggle, and decided to combine the image classification model and the U-Net model for segmentation into the final model.
I think this approach is better than just using U-Net in the future. The metrics of each model need to be improved.
I also trained my model using GPU on Kaggle and each epoch took about 4 hours. So, unfortunately, I can't show you the final metrics.

The functions are distributed in the . 
All necessary packages and libraries are located in requerement.txt 

You should also review the function for image augmentation and choose the changes that would positively affect the metrics.
